## 2025-02-20 - Component Library Optimization
**Learning:** In a component library without a consuming app, `React.memo` is a proactive optimization. While technically "premature" without a bottleneck, it is a standard for shared primitives to prevent downstream re-renders.
**Action:** When working on isolated components, justify `memo` as an enabler for consumer performance, even if local impact is unmeasurable.
