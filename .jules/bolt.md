# Bolt's Journal

## 2025-02-23 - Initial Setup
**Learning:** Performance journals are critical for tracking insights.
**Action:** Created this file to track future critical learnings.

## 2025-02-20 - Component Library Optimization
**Learning:** In a component library without a consuming app, `React.memo` is a proactive optimization. While technically "premature" without a bottleneck, it is a standard for shared primitives to prevent downstream re-renders.
**Action:** When working on isolated components, justify `memo` as an enabler for consumer performance, even if local impact is unmeasurable.

## 2025-02-23 - Static JSX Extraction
**Learning:** Extracting static React Elements (like SVG children) to module-level constants avoids object allocation during render, even if the component is memoized.
**Action:** For complex static sub-trees (like icons or illustrations), define them outside the component.
